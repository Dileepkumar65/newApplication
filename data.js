        description: 'The fundamental building blocks of computation',
        content: '<h3>1. Boolean Algebra Fundamentals</h3>\n<p>Boolean algebra, developed by George Boole in the 19th century, provides the mathematical foundation for all digital systems. Unlike traditional algebra which works with continuous numerical values, Boolean algebra operates on binary values (true/false, 1/0) and defines operations that manipulate these values.</p>\n<p>The three fundamental Boolean operations are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AND</strong>: Output is true only when both inputs are true</li>\n<li><strong>OR</strong>: Output is true when at least one input is true</li>\n<li><strong>NOT</strong>: Output is the opposite of the input (inverts the value)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In Boolean algebra, these operations are rigorously defined with truth tables and algebraic laws that allow us to analyze and manipulate logical expressions. By understanding and applying Boolean algebra, we can design digital circuits that perform specific logical functions.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Implementing Logic with Transistors</h3>\n<p>Transistors are the physical devices that implement Boolean logic in hardware. A transistor can act as an electronically controlled switch, allowing or blocking the flow of current based on a control signal. By arranging transistors in specific configurations, we can create physical implementations of logical operations.</p>\n<p>The two main types of transistor logic families are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic)</strong>: Uses bipolar junction transistors</li>\n<li><strong>CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor)</strong>: Uses field-effect transistors in complementary pairs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When building from scratch, we\'ll examine how transistors function at the quantum level and how their physical properties enable them to implement logical operations. Rather than taking these components as black boxes, we\'ll understand exactly how electrons flow through semiconductor materials to create switching behavior.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Basic Logic Gates</h3>\n<p>Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of digital circuits, directly implementing Boolean functions. Each type of gate performs a specific logical operation on its inputs.</p>\n<p>The basic gates include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AND Gate</strong>: Output is high (1) only when all inputs are high</li>\n<li><strong>OR Gate</strong>: Output is high when at least one input is high</li>\n<li><strong>NOT Gate (Inverter)</strong>: Output is the opposite of the input</li>\n<li><strong>NAND Gate</strong>: Combines AND and NOT operations (universal gate)</li>\n<li><strong>NOR Gate</strong>: Combines OR and NOT operations (universal gate)</li>\n<li><strong>XOR Gate</strong>: Output is high when inputs are different</li>\n<li><strong>XNOR Gate</strong>: Output is high when inputs are the same</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We\'ll implement each of these gates from transistors, understanding their internal structure rather than treating them as prefabricated components. This approach reveals how complex logical functions can be built from simple electronic components.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Combinational Logic Circuits</h3>\n<p>Combinational circuits perform operations where the output depends only on the current input values, without any memory of previous states. These circuits combine multiple logic gates to implement more complex functions.</p>\n<p>Key combinational circuits include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multiplexers (MUX)</strong>: Select one of several input signals based on control inputs</li>\n<li><strong>Demultiplexers (DEMUX)</strong>: Route an input signal to one of several outputs</li>\n<li><strong>Encoders</strong>: Convert multiple input signals into a binary code</li>\n<li><strong>Decoders</strong>: Convert a binary code into multiple output signals</li>\n<li><strong>Adders</strong>: Perform binary addition on two or more numbers</li>\n<li><strong>Comparators</strong>: Compare two binary numbers and determine their relationship</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By building these circuits from basic gates (which we\'ve already built from transistors), we\'ll gain a comprehensive understanding of how complex logical operations can be implemented in hardware.</p>\n\n<h3>5. Sequential Logic and Memory</h3>\n<p>While combinational logic computes based solely on current inputs, sequential logic allows circuits to have memory and maintain state over time. This is achieved through feedback loops and storage elements.</p>\n<p>The fundamental sequential elements include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Latches</strong>: Basic storage elements that hold a value as long as enabled</li>\n<li><strong>Flip-flops</strong>: Edge-triggered storage elements that change state only at specific clock transitions</li>\n<li><strong>Registers</strong>: Groups of flip-flops that store multiple bits of information</li>\n<li><strong>Counters</strong>: Sequential circuits that cycle through a sequence of states</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We\'ll build these sequential components from scratch using our fundamental gates, understanding how feedback and timing create memory in electronic systems. This forms the bridge between combinational logic and more complex computational systems with state.</p>',

Foundations of Information Theory</h3>\n<p>Information theory, developed by Claude Shannon in the 1940s, provides a mathematical framework for quantifying information and understanding the fundamental limits of data compression and transmission. This revolutionary framework bridges mathematics, physics, and computer science.</p>\n<p>Key concepts in information theory include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Information and Uncertainty</strong>: Information resolves uncertainty; the more uncertain an outcome, the more information is gained when learning it</li>\n<li><strong>Probability Distributions</strong>: The likelihood of different messages or symbols appearing in a communication stream</li>\n<li><strong>Surprise Value</strong>: Rare events carry more information than common ones</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We\'ll explore these concepts from first principles, deriving the mathematical relationships rather than accepting them as given, building a strong foundation for understanding how information can be measured, stored, and communicated efficiently.</p>\n\n<h3>2.

Data Compression Algorithms</h3>\n<p>Data compression reduces the size of information for efficient storage and transmission, applying information theory principles to practical systems. This section focuses on lossless compression techniques that allow perfect reconstruction of the original data.</p>\n<p>We\'ll implement several key compression algorithms from scratch:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Run-Length Encoding</strong>: Compressing sequences of repeated values</li>\n<li><strong>Huffman Coding</strong>: Creating optimal variable-length prefix codes based on symbol frequencies</li>\n<li><strong>Arithmetic Coding</strong>: Encoding entire messages as fractional numbers for near-optimal compression</li>\n<li><strong>Dictionary Methods</strong>: LZ77, LZ78, and LZW algorithms that build dictionaries of repeated patterns</li>\n<li><strong>Context Modeling</strong>: Using previous symbols to predict and efficiently encode the next symbol</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By building these algorithms from their mathematical foundations rather than using existing libraries, we\'ll understand exactly how each technique works, their computational complexity, and how they approach the theoretical limits established by information theory.</p>\n\n<h3>5. Digital Media Representation</h3>\n<p>This section explores how complex forms of information like text, images, audio, and video are represented in digital systems, applying information theory principles to real-world media formats.</p>\n<p>We\'ll examine representation schemes for various media types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Text Encoding</strong>: Character sets (ASCII, Unicode), text compression, and search structures</li>\n<li><strong>Image Representation</strong>: Bitmap formats, color spaces, spatial/frequency domain representations</li>\n<li><strong>Audio Encoding</strong>: Sampling, quantization, time and frequency domain representations</li>\n<li><strong>Video Formats</strong>: Frame-based representation, motion compensation, temporal compression</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For each media type, we\'ll implement basic encoders and decoders from scratch, understanding how information theory principles lead to efficient representations.
